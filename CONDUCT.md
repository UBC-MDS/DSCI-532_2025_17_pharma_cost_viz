# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We aim to create a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive environment for everyone participating in our project. Everyone participating in DSCI 532 group 17 activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by DSCI 532 group 17 including, but not limited to, group meetings, slack communication, and online forums such as GitHub.

The group members are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct. All reports will be reviewed by the members and will be kept confidential.

## The DSCI 532 Group 17 Code of Conduct

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

Everyone participating in DSCI 532 Group 17 activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by DSCI 532 group 17 including, but not limited to, group meetings, slack communication, and online forums such as GitHub. 

### Expected Behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all DSCI 532 group 17 projects and platforms:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any DSCI 532 group 17 event/platform include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop publication of private communication without consent

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any DSCI 532 group 17 events and platforms, whether online or in person. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, group members may issue a warning to the offender or escalate the matter to the DSCI 532 Instructor for further investigation and appropriate action.

### Incident Reporting Guidelines

If someone violates the Code of Conduct during an event or in an online space outside of organized events, we ask that you report it to the instructor(s). The current instructor(s) of DSCI 532 is Joel Ostblom.

For any concerns or reports, you may also reach out to the team via email at zhangj24@student.ubc.ca.
